Algorithms 

Breadth-First-Search:
	Using a queue
Depth-First-Search:
	Using a stack.

Depth-First-Search (Recusrive):
	DFS Recursive makes a call to the immediate neighbour found. 
	Basically a first order traversal of the dependancy structure.
		
Kurshals:
	?
Topological Sort:
	Topological Sort. Bacically we compute G and G^T. Then we run DFS on G and DFS on G^T

Is DAG?
	Directed Acyclic Graph overwhich we can preform a Topological Sort. 
DFS Tree?

Cross Edge, Back Edge, Forward Edge, Tree Edge:
	Cross Edge is if two nodes are connected in G, and in the DFS Tree are separated bloodlines.
	ie one is not a direct decendant of the other. Then e(u, v) is a cross edge.

	Forward Edge. 

	Back Edge. The existance of a back edge implies that the Graph is cyclic and therfore not
	a DAG
